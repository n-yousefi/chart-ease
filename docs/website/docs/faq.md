- How do I make my charts accessible to **users with disabilities**?
  Ensure chart accessibility by providing alt text for SVG elements, implementing keyboard navigation, and offering alternative data presentations, such as data tables or textual descriptions. Follow web accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG) to make your charts inclusive.
